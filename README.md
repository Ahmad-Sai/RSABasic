What is RSA? 

RSA is an asymptotic encryption algorithm that uses a public-key to encrypt a message and a private key to decrypt a message. RSA is a good encryption algorithm because it uses 2 very large prime numbers as the starting point for the encryption process. Cracking the RSA encryption is very difficult, and needless to say it is very computational and time consuming. This means that only you, with your private key, can decrypt an encrypted message sent to you.

A simple and clean RSA implementation in Python.

Requires an OS randomness source for SystemRandom().
